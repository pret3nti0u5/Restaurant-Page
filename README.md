# Persona 5 X Pok√©mon Cafe

### This is a Restaurant Web Page for a fictional collab between Persona 5 and Pokemon.

`P.S: I know the premise for the website doesn't make a whole lot of sense, it was just the first two things that came to my mind when I thought of making this website.`

**Note:** This Website works best with High Resolution Screens (1080p and up). Check the [improvements section](#improvements) for future updates.
